This is an example implementation of a C# console application that simulates processing a large dataset by sorting it. 
The code is optimized for performance and includes security measures to prevent common vulnerabilities.

Performance Improvements Achieved:
Quicksort Algorithm: Implemented Quicksort algorithm for sorting the dataset. Quicksort is efficient and has an average time complexity of O(n log n), providing faster sorting compared to other algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort.

Random Dataset Generation: Used a random number generator to generate a large dataset of integers. This ensures that the dataset is sufficiently large for testing and optimization.

Security Measures Implemented:
Input Validation: Validated user input to prevent format exceptions, overflow exceptions, and to ensure the entered index is within the bounds of the dataset.

Exception Handling: Implemented exception handling to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent potential vulnerabilities like information leakage.

This implementation addresses the requirements of the task by optimizing code for speed and efficiency while implementing security best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
